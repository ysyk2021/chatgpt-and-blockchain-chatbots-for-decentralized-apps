Blockchain technology is a decentralized, distributed ledger that records transactions across a network of computers. Each block in the chain contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, ensuring the integrity and security of the system.

This decentralized architecture eliminates the need for intermediaries and provides enhanced security and transparency, making it ideal for a wide range of applications.

The concept of blockchain was first introduced in 2008 by an individual or group of individuals using the pseudonym "Satoshi Nakamoto" in a whitepaper titled "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System". The paper described a decentralized payment system based on a blockchain.

Since then, blockchain technology has expanded beyond cryptocurrency to include a variety of other applications, including smart contracts, supply chain management, and voting systems.

Overall, the key characteristics of blockchain technology include decentralization, immutability, transparency, and security. By leveraging these features, developers can create innovative solutions that provide enhanced security, efficiency, and transparency compared to traditional centralized systems.
